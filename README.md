# Battleships
An iteration of the battleships game where you can play against a computer in two different ways vs a computer: on hit per turn or 7 hits per turn.  
Implementation is done in C++ using the conio library for realisation of the graphic interface.  
Code is hard to follow, as it has everything in a single file.
